Repo for exploring growth curve modeling

We're starting by looking at paper by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.13062">Valentini and Serratrice (2021)</a> who employed latent growth curve modeling in a similiar study design as ours (longitudinal study with coarse- and fine-grained measures, but fewer timespoints). They used <a href="https://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/growth.html">lavaan</a> package which we could also look into.
